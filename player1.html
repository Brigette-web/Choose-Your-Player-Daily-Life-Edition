    <p>Bonjour, Hallo, hola, hi! My name is Cyrel from STEM 11-A. Before diving deep into my life, let me introduce myself first. Hello again, my full name is Cyrel Emlarinag from STEM 11-A. I'm 16 years old, son of Anita, son of Edwin, grandchild of Lola Bebe, and grandchild of Lolo Berto. And I'm going to share with the world what I do in my lifeâ€”even though it's pretty boring.<p>
    
     <p>The moment I wake up, I will stare at the ceiling for about 5 minutes, and I just don't know why I do that, but probably because I'm a bed prisoner. Anyway, once I get up, I get out to bathe myself in the sun's rays to get vitamin D and other helpful stuff. After that, well... It's totally random; I don't have an everyday routine like an organized list, so it's really chaotic, but anyway, I'm still going to share what I do in my life.<p>  <div class="image-container">

        <p>One thing that I'm most enthralled to do in my daily activity is to explore. My house is 20 steps away from the forest; whenever I have nothing to do in the house, like chores, I simply get out, bring my cellphone, go to the woods, and take pictures of the things I find interesting, especially insects and plants. In the picture that I provided, that is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mole_cricket" target="_blank">Mole Cricket</a>, although it's not really something to be amazed of since it's not endangered, but it's kind of rare to see one because they mostly live their lives underground.<p>

            <img src=".images/player 1 2nd.jpg" alt="" class="centered-image">
        </div>
        <p>Another thing that I do is to help my mom <a href="https://forages.oregonstate.edu/nfgc/eo/onlineforagecurriculum/instructormaterials/availabletopics/nitrogentfixation/inoculation#:~:text=Inoculation%20may%20be%20defined%20as,legume%2Dbacterial%20symbiosis%20is%20established." target="_blank">Inoculate</a> baby plants, specifically bananas. Although this isn't practice in my everyday life, I just help her whenever I feel like it, but it's fun though considering that inoculation is applied science and science is my favorite subject. In the picture above, you really need a lot of focus due to the fact that you can only use tweezers to do the process of inoculation, and as you can see, the small banana plants are healthy because I did a great job.<p>
  
        <p>Most of the time I stay in Grandma's little <a href="https://www.careerexplorer.com/careers/street-vendor/" target="_blank">Street Vendor</a> to help her with the demanding customers. I really enjoy it since I can just eat her products whenever I feel hungry, and it's free. The only thing I don't like is the ambience. I mean, it's a street vendor; it's near the street, and in the street, it's full of cacophony of noises from the cars and black glasses propelling in the atmosphere. It's kinda a bit nostalgic to think about though.<p>

        </div>   
        <p>In conclusion, I don't really have any specific tasks or an organized list to do every day; I just do things whenever I feel like it. Although I do household chores every day, I just didn't mention any of it because it's generic. Anyway, thanks for reading all of that; I appreciate your time.</p>
