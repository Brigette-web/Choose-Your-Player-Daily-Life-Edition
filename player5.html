    <h1>Welcome to Chizter's Daily Life!</h1>

    <p>Greetings, mortals! From heroes to villains, slimes to shadow monarchs, and archons to mere mortals. It is I, Chizter Earl P Ecartin from STEM 11-A! Born on July 4, 2007, I am currently 17 years old—just one step away from adulthood. But let’s be honest, if this were an isekai, I’d rather stay in my teenage years and farm EXP rather than worry about real-life responsibilities. Anyway, allow this handsome protagonist to take you on a journey through my daily life.<p>

        <p>There’s one thing I do religiously every day—lazing around. If life were That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime, I’d be Rimuru before getting OP, just chilling in my cave, avoiding unnecessary work. But alas, reality is cruel. Instead of evolving into a Demon Lord, I have to deal with schoolwork and chores—two things that stand in the way of my inner peace. And trust me, defying these obstacles would summon an S-rank boss battle in the form of my mom, wielding the Legendary Belt of Discipline.<p>
        
        <p>The greatest challenge in my daily quest? Waking up early. I am not a morning person, and if this were <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GDKHZEJ0K/solo-leveling?srsltid=AfmBOoqk9ojjruL9mPSpjsj-FLYt8YUOkH2n5JV6xB0pQAHDplMxm688" target="_blank">Solo Leveling</a>, my daily raid boss would be the 5:45 AM school schedule. No matter how many alarms I set—30 to 40, like some kind of ritual summoning—I still struggle to wake up. If I had Zhongli’s Dominus Lapidis, I’d petrify time itself just to get more sleep. But unfortunately, the only thing I can do is set my alarm to 5 AM, forcing myself to speedrun my morning routine in 45 minutes.<p>
        
        <p>Speaking of my morning routine, it goes something like this:<p>
        
    <ul>        
        <li> Waking up (after what feels like a resurrection scene)</li>        
        <li> Taking a bath while blasting Ado songs (because every protagonist needs a theme song)</li>       
        <li> Watching some hema videos as I eat breakfast (buffing my hema techniques)</li>       
        <li> Dressing up, styling my hair like a proper student, and chugging down a cup of coffee like I’m trying to unlock a new awakening</li>
        
        
        <p>Then, it’s time for my fast-travel mechanic—a quick tricycle ride to school, where I usually arrive at 5:00 AM. "Well damn, I’m late as hell." But honestly, I don’t care. As long as I look good, my stats are still maxed out. At recess, I usually have fried rice or buchi, depending on whether I’m truly hungry or just need a light stamina refill. If only I had a cooking skill like shuna’s, oh that's right I do I could whip up a feast in an instant. After school, I head straight home, where I instantly collapse into bed for my mandatory four-hour nap—because even heroes need to recover HP. Once I’m awake, I do some chores (begrudgingly, as if I’m forced into a side quest), then proceed to my true free time, where I can finally enjoy the things that matter:

    <ul>       
        <li> Anime and Manhwa – Mostly fantasy and supernatural ones, because if I’m going to escape reality, it better be a world where I have insane powers. Titles like Solo Leveling and Tensura fuel my desire to be OP in another world.</li>   
        <li> <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/m/en/" target="_blank">Genshin Impact</a> – Grinding for primogems, failing artifact rolls, and occasionally crying over bad pulls. My account is probably cursed by the RNG gods, but I refuse to give up.</li>        
        <li>Food – Specifically fried chicken. If I lived in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Time_I_Got_Reincarnated_as_a_Slime" target="_blank">Tensura's</a> world, I’d 100% open a fried chicken shop in Tempest. Even Demon Lords would kneel for my crispy, golden masterpiece.</li>        
        <li>Music – just the Normal Arthur nery and all that romantic crap.</li>
        
        
       <p> On weekends (or if there’s no class), I truly ascend into my peak form—meaning I sleep even more. However, I do make time for some productive things, like:<p>
        
    <ul>
       <li> Working out – Because every protagonist needs to be in top shape. Plus, if I ever get isekai’d, I refuse to be the weak side character who gets taken out in episode one.</li>   
       <li> Hema– My IRL ranking system. Occasionally, my coach notifies me about upcoming tournaments, and I join them like a seasoned adventurer taking on high-level dungeons.</li>
       <li> Hanging out with friends – Rarely, because I am a certified house person. If my friends invite me out, it all depends on whether my wallet has enough Mora—uh, I mean money.</li>
            
       <p> And that, my dear readers, sums up my daily life as a modern-day otaku gamer with a love for fried chicken and fantasy worlds. If you enjoyed this story, make sure to hit that like and subscribe button and ring the bell icon for future updates!</p>
