        <p>Hi! I’m Brigette Fionna E. Soria, and this is a glimpse into my everyday life. It may be boring to some, but to me, it’s just how I roll—school, sleep, random thoughts, and, of course, a little bit of fun. Whether it’s waking up at dawn, taking pictures of the sky, or getting lost in made-up scenarios before bed, my routine is simple but uniquely mine. Want to know more? Keep reading!<p>

         <p>I wake up at 4:00 AM—but let’s be honest, I don’t get up right away. I lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, questioning my life decisions (just kidding… or maybe not). Sometimes, I create random scenarios in my head before actually starting my day. Once I feel awake enough, I begin my <a href="https://operationxcel.org/news/blog.html/article/2023/07/24/5-ways-to-establish-a-productive-morning-routine?gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI9oKByp75iwMVRyCDAx2IThS7EAAYAiAAEgJvBvD_BwE" target="_blank"> morning routine</a> take a bath, wear my school uniform, eat breakfast, brush my teeth, prepare myself for school. Before heading out, I always take a moment to admire the sky—maybe even snap a quick picture.<p>

        <p> After school, I change into my comfy clothes, eat lunch, and… lay down all day. Yes, I love sleeping, so I usually nap in the afternoon. When I wake up, I work on my homework and activities. Once that’s done, it’s finally phone time—scrolling through TikTok, chatting with friends, or reading. Before bed, I eat dinner, brush my teeth, and… back to creating scenarios in my head. Some are so tragic they make my heart ache (or even make me cry, lol). Then, I finally drift off to sleep.<p>

      <p>  On weekends, I get to sleep in until 7:00 AM—a much-needed break from my early weekday alarms. My routine is pretty simple: eat breakfast, brush my teeth, do my assigned household chores, do homework (if there is one), use my phone (of course!). Sometimes, I practice playing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyboard_instrument" target="_blank">keyboard</a>, but let’s be real—there are days when I’m just too lazy to do it. Still, I’m learning at my own pace!<p>
        
      <p>And that’s pretty much my daily life. It’s a mix of school, naps, <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/browse/scenario" target="_blank">scenarios</a> in my head, and lots of phone time.</p>
