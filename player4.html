        <p> My alarm clock screams at 4:30 AM. I don't like it, but I get up. First, I go to the bathroom and getting ready for shower, toothbrush, wearing a school uniform, and do my skincare routine. After doing my skincare, I drink milk only because I don’t eat breakfast before I go to the school. I check my schedule, grab my bag and phone, and finally, head out the door, ready to face whatever the school day may bring.<p>

        <p> After my school, I go home and not going anywhere because so many homework will do, and I preferred at home rather than going somewhere else. Every afternoon, I sleep 3 hours before doing my homework but before that, I read my <a href="https://www.odbm.org" target="_blank">Our Daily Bread</a> for 1 hour and doing my <a href="https://todaydevotional.com" target="_blank">devotional</a>.<p>

        <p> When I got bored, I always playing music, playing with my cats and playing online game. It's a chance to unwind, to express myself, and to escape the pressures of school.  This is my time to recharge and reconnect with what truly matters. And before I sleep, I thank God for his goodness and guiding me through my life.<p>
