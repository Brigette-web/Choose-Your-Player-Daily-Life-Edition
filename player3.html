    <p>Greetings! People from rich to poor, black and white, short and tall. It is I, Alexandre Mabale from STEM 11 A. I was born in August 6, 2007 and I'm currently 17 years old which is one year away from adult life. Anyways, let this handsome lad tell you about his daily life. To be honest, I don't do much things that are interesting in my everyday life but if you're willing to discover more about me suit thyself.<p>

      <p>  There is only one common thing that I do everyday in my life; and that is to laze around. I seriously wish I could just relax and sleep whenever I want but reality is often disappointing, things just won't go the way you want them to be. Of course there are obstacles such as chores and school activities on one's path to inner peace. Moreover, If I try to defy these obstacles my mom who I describe as death would come to me with the legendary weapon belt everytime I did that. Anyway, In my everyday life there is one thing that I struggle to do everytime; and that is to wake up early. You see, I'm not a morning person so I used to wake up every 7 am back when the school schedule was 7:30 am. However, now that my school schedule is 5:45 am, I am forced to wake myself up early every goddamn time. I would activate multiple alarms and there's like 30 - 40 of them everyday but it still won't wake me up early. That's how hard it is to wake me up early. Due to this particular reason, I am always late in school and as time passed by I started to accept it and just set my alarm to 5 since I could somehow manage waking up at 5 am but not 3am - 4am. I have just like 45 minutes to get ready for school but I don't care anymore. There are only two words that kinda motivates me everytime I go to school: Saturday and Sunday. Weekends are the only days where I can rest in peace (not death lol) but I would not call it a true inner peace since I would still be pestered my chores and school assignments but atleast it's close.<p>

        <p>   By the way my mornings in school days (monday to friday) usually goes like this: waking up, taking a bath while listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ado_(singer)" target="_blank">Ado</a>'s songs, turning the tv on and pressing some gothamchess content as I eat my breakfast, dressing up and fixing my hair handsomely  while listening to music again, and lastly drinking a cup of coffee as I witness the sun  rise lightening the benevolent darkness around. Keep in mind that I do all this in 45 minutes. After all that, I would then call a tricycle and have a usual 5-10 minute ride and arrive at school at 5:55. "Well damn, I'm late as hell" after saying that I would then line up with the fellow late comers and wait until the teacher says go. Well I don't care if I'm late at the very least I'm handsome as hell. By the way, my everyday recess in the canteen is usually fried rice or boiled egg depending on my mood if I'm hungry or not so hungry respectively. After school, the moment I go home, I would go straight to bed and have my usual 4 hours sleep and then do some chores after waking up then do some school assignments (as if) then my free time would go to anime, manga, novels, music, and chess and after that, I go back to my comfortable slumber. <p>

        <p>   Moving on to my daily life in weekends or if there's no class, I would usually just laze around and sleep after doing some chores and stuff to make up for my suffering in school. Most of the time in my weekends, I would watch some animes about fantasy and supernatural similar to frieren and attack on titan, I would read manga and novels still abiut fantasy and supernatural if I ever feel like reading, and also I would listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ado_(singer)" target="_blank">Ado</a>'s songs as I rest. However instead of lazing around, sometimes I would do some meaningful things like working out since I want to become physically fit and healthy and of course to keep my handsomeness. Obviously I can't just leave out my career in sport which is chess so occasionally I would also increase my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system" target="_blank">Elo rating</a>. I'm a rated chess player and sometimes my coach would sometimes notify my if there's tournaments and I would join in some tournaments often. There would also be times where I would sing in karaoke for fun. I'm gonna let you know that I'm a big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introvert" target="_blank">introvert</a> and also a house person so I rarely go out from my house. However, occasionally my friends would invite me to hang out and It really depends on my budget if I would go or not or if they will take care of the financial stuff hehe.<p>
